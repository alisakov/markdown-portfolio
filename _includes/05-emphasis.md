I have experience writing code in _**Python**_ and _**C**_ and in using _**Linux's command line**_.
I write _**automations for instruments**_ at my job.
Other than programming, I am _**drawing proffesionally**_, and my _**English**_ language is great although I don't live in an English speaking country :sparkles:
